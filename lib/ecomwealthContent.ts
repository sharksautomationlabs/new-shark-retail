  { id: 'precall-2', question: 'How Do I Know This Is a Real Service, Not Just a Course?', answer: 'We provide a fully done-for-you service. Our team builds your store, sources products, handles listings, fulfillment, and customer service. You receive a live, operating store—not just training or course materials.' },
  { id: 'precall-3', question: 'Why Should I Trust You?', answer: 'We operate with full transparency. Our team has years of experience in e-commerce. We share real client results, offer clear contracts, and our incentives are aligned—we only succeed when your store succeeds.' },
  { id: 'precall-4', question: 'What Does the Upfront Capital Actually Cover?', answer: 'Your investment covers store setup, product research, supplier relationships, listing creation, and initial operational costs. We outline all costs clearly before you commit.' },
  { id: 'precall-5', question: 'Where Does My Investment Go?', answer: 'Your investment goes directly toward building and launching your store: platform fees, product sourcing, professional listing creation, and our operational infrastructure. We are transparent about where every dollar goes.' },
  { id: 'precall-6', question: 'How Do I Know You\'re Motivated to Make My Store Work?', answer: 'Our revenue is tied to your store\'s success. We have skin in the game. Our performance assurance and ongoing support show we are committed to delivering results.' },
  { id: 'precall-7', question: 'What Are Realistic Profit Expectations?', answer: 'Results vary based on capital, product selection, and market conditions. We share case studies of client results, but we do not guarantee specific returns. Many clients see sales within the first few weeks.' },
  { id: 'precall-8', question: 'When Will I Actually Start Seeing Profits?', answer: 'Many clients see their first sale within 1-2 weeks of their store going live. Profits build over time as the store gains traction. We provide regular updates so you can track progress.' },
  { id: 'precall-9', question: 'How Does This Compare to Real Estate or Stocks?', answer: 'Unlike stocks or real estate, you own an operating business. You have direct visibility into sales, inventory, and operations. It\'s hands-off in that we run it, but you retain full ownership.' },
  { id: 'precall-10', question: 'How Long Does It Take to Get Started?', answer: 'Typically 14-30 days from our initial call to a live store. We handle setup, product sourcing, and listing creation. You approve key decisions and we execute.' },

  { id: 'precall-12', question: 'What Are My Responsibilities as the Store Owner?', answer: 'You approve major decisions (product selection, suppliers), review weekly performance updates, and ensure your payment/account details are in order. We handle day-to-day operations.' },
  { id: 'precall-13', question: 'How Much Time Do I Actually Have to Spend on This?', answer: 'Most partners spend 30-60 minutes per week reviewing updates and approving occasional decisions. It\'s designed to be passive—we run the store; you monitor results.' },
  { id: 'precall-14', question: 'Do I Really Own the Store?', answer: 'Yes. The store is registered in your name. You own the business, the revenue, and the assets. We manage operations under our agreement.' },
  { id: 'precall-15', question: 'Will I Still Have Visibility and Control?', answer: 'Absolutely. You get dashboard access, weekly reports, and direct communication with your account manager. You approve key decisions and can review everything at any time.' },
  { id: 'precall-16', question: 'Is There Any Guarantee?', answer: 'Yes. We offer a performance assurance. If your store does not meet agreed benchmarks within the timeframe, we continue managing at no extra cost until it does. Full details are provided during your call.' },
  { id: 'precall-17', question: 'How Well Are Current Clients Doing?', answer: 'We share anonymized case studies and results with qualified applicants. Many clients have seen significant revenue within their first 6-12 months. Individual results vary.' },
  { id: 'precall-18', question: 'How Many Clients Do You Manage?', answer: 'We are selective and work with a limited number of partners to ensure quality. Our team is structured to give each store the attention it needs to succeed.' },

    question: 'What Is The Retail Automation?',
    answer: 'The Retail Automation builds, launches, and manages fully done-for-you eCommerce stores. We handle everything—from store setup and supplier sourcing to daily operations, order fulfillment, customer service, and ongoing scaling—so you can earn hands-off without buying inventory upfront or needing eCommerce experience.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-2',
    question: 'Do I Need Any Experience?',
    answer: 'No experience is required. Our team manages 100% of the store\'s operations. Your role is simply approving decisions and reviewing performance updates. We\'ve helped complete beginners, busy professionals, and business owners successfully launch automated stores.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-3',
    question: 'How Much Time Will I Need To Invest?',
    answer: 'Most clients spend 30–60 minutes per week reviewing updates or approving small decisions. We handle product research, listings, fulfillment, customer service, and optimization. It\'s designed to be as passive and hands-off as possible.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-4',
    question: 'How Long Will It Take to Start Seeing Results?',
    answer: 'Many clients begin seeing sales within the first 1-2 weeks after their store goes live. Early traction varies based on seasonality, supplier availability, and account performance. Our onboarding is built to get your store active quickly.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-5',
    question: 'Do I need to buy inventory upfront?',
    answer: 'No, you never purchase inventory upfront. With our model, your customers pay for the product before the supplier ships it. This removes risk and allows your store to scale without major upfront costs.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    question: 'How hands-off is this for me?',
    answer: 'Extremely hands-off. We manage product research, supplier relations, order fulfillment, shipment tracking, customer service, and account health. You simply monitor results and enjoy the growth.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-7',
    question: 'Is there a guarantee?',
    answer: 'Yes — we offer a performance assurance. If your store does not generate at least your initial investment in net profit within the agreed timeframe, we continue managing it at no additional cost until it does. This keeps our incentives fully aligned with yours.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-8',
    question: 'What makes this different from traditional dropshipping?',
    answer: 'Traditional dropshipping requires daily order processing, customer service, ad spend, and a lot of manual work. Our system removes all of that — no ads, no inventory, no order handling, and no technical setup. You get a fully managed backend team operating your business for you.',
